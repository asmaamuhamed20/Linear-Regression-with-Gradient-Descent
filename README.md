# Linear-Regression-with-Gradient-Descent


Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement Linear Regression using Python and Gradient Descent from scratch.

Dataset

The dataset consists of population sizes and corresponding business profits.

Files

linear_regression.py: The main Python script that loads data, trains the model, and visualizes the results.

data.txt: The dataset file (Population vs. Profit).

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linear-regression.git
cd linear-regression

Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8+).

Install dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib

Run the script:
python linear_regression.py

Output

A scatter plot of the dataset.

A fitted regression line.

A cost vs. iteration graph to visualize training convergence.
